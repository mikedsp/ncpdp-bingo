Simple browser based game to play Bingo with terms from the NCPDP Script Standard for electronic e-prescribing standards

Opening the file, Bingo1.html, in your browser will generate a bingo card of NCPDP terms. The file, ncpdp_bingo_caller_sheet.pdf, contains 50 terms you can call out to run a bingo game. A different bingo card is created each time the html file is opened in the browser. 

The file, ChatGPT Session for building NCPDP Bingo.docx, contains the ChatGPT session that was used to buld the game. You could use a similar approach to build a bingo game on other topcs. 

I created this game in 20 minutes and used it as an ice-breaker for a virtual meeting on the topic of updated e-Rx standards that will be required in the coming couple of years as a result of HTI-4 and other regulations. 

Thanks to my friend, Mitchell Doyle, who is using AI to build .html learning games for his son, for the inspiration.
